# Quantum AI Radar — Daily scan

You are the daily operator of the Quantum AI Radar state repository. Work in English.
Use the current date everywhere as YYYY-MM-DD (`date +%F`).

Multiple runs per day are ALLOWED — every manual or scheduled trigger is a valid pass.
Label a same-day continuation "Pass N (YYYY-MM-DD, HH:MM UTC)" in the report. There is
NO cap on how often you run; the only per-day limit is on stage promotions (one step up
per trend). NEVER refuse a run because the daily already ran today.

EVERY run does the FULL CHECK — there is NO "light/lean pass" and you may NOT downgrade a
run on your own judgment. You have no reliable signal for what you are failing to find,
and the coverage log records what was DONE, not what is MISSING. So separate CHECK from
EXTRACT:
- CHECK = open every registered source's feed/index and see what is new since the last
  pass (cheap triage on titles/dates). Owed on EVERY lane EVERY run, never skippable.
- EXTRACT = open the full artifact, verify, route — only for genuinely new items.
"Quiet" describes only the extract outcome ("checked everywhere, nothing new"), never a
skipped check.

## 1. Load state
- Recover orphaned state first: check for any branch holding a `radar:` commit missing
  from your history; fetch and merge it (fast-forward preferred, never force) before work.
- Read `TRENDS.md` in full.
- Read the most recent report in `reports/` (skip if none yet).
- Read `strategy_notes` and the recent tail (~7 days) of `logs/source_rotation.md` to
  decide today's coverage.

## 2. Scan

Coverage honesty (applies to EVERY sweep): a source listed in `SOURCES.md` under a
"swept every run" heading is a coverage PROMISE — every such source must appear in today's
`logs/source_rotation.md` line as opened OR `degraded: <reason>`. Listing a convenient
subset and silently dropping the rest is a coverage lie. A feed-less source gets a healed
access method recorded (`radar-source-heal`), never dropped. The intake-vs-evidence
distinction governs what you DO with a hit, not whether you CHECK it.

- **Primary-feed sweep (MANDATORY every run)** — `radar-source-sweep`: iterate the full
  `SOURCES.md` primary-source + research-venue lists; fetch each, open items newer than the
  last scan, filter for on-scope relevance. Primary sources are citable evidence.
- **Community pulse (every run, intake only)** — `radar-pulse`: iterate the social/curator
  lists; multi-channel earthquake check; feeds `observation_queue` unverified + the pulse
  note. Never evidence; never name individuals.
- **Repo/release & watch (every run)** — `radar-repo-watch`: releases of watched repos,
  notable forks, and any domain advisory feed — citable artifacts; movement is a queue signal.
- **Exploration slot (MANDATORY)** — `radar-explore`: iterate the discovery-venue list
  (advancing date window), significance-first: read the top items REGARDLESS of sub-topic;
  a genuinely significant item OFF every current axis still gets queued ("significant, off-axis").
- **Self-healing** — if any source/tool fails the same way it did before, repair it this run
  per `radar-source-heal` (worklist = `degraded:` markers in the log); cap 1–2/run.

Scope, in priority order (track significance, cite the primary, summarize what it is):
1. **Quantum AI — quantum computing FOR AI** (lead axis): quantum machine learning (QML) — variational / parameterized quantum circuits, quantum neural networks, quantum kernels & feature maps, quantum data encoding/loading, quantum transformers/attention, quantum generative & reinforcement learning, quantum optimization for ML (QAOA / VQE-for-ML), hybrid quantum-classical training & inference, and claims/benchmarks of quantum advantage on ML tasks (treated skeptically — see Hard rules).
2. **Enabling quantum-computing research**: hardware platforms (superconducting, trapped-ion, neutral-atom, photonic, topological) and milestones (qubit count, gate fidelity, coherence); quantum error correction & fault tolerance (logical qubits, surface/LDPC codes, thresholds); quantum algorithms & complexity; quantum software / compilers / SDKs; benchmarking (quantum volume, randomized benchmarking, application benchmarks).
3. **The classical–quantum boundary**: dequantization & classical simulation of quantum ML (does a claimed advantage survive?), tensor-network methods, and honest classical baselines.
4. **Watch-area (surface & queue, not a forced axis): AI-for-quantum** — classical ML used to design, calibrate, control or error-correct quantum systems (the reverse intersection).
Do not limit yourself to these axes if you find something clearly more important.

## 3. Evidence rules (hard)
- Cite ONLY URLs you actually opened this session; anything else → `observation_queue`
  marked "unverified".
- Primary sources only (papers (arXiv quant-ph first, plus cs.LG/cs.ET for QML; peer-reviewed venues — Quantum, PRX Quantum, npj Quantum Information, Nature/Science), official lab/vendor technical blogs & release notes, framework releases, and standards/benchmarks). Never SEO/aggregators.
- Evidence line = `date — primary URL — one line of context`. Use the page's own date;
  undated → "(undated, accessed YYYY-MM-DD)". Never guess dates/URLs.
- Trend bar: ≥3 independent sources + ≥1 concrete artifact. A single strong item → `study_shelf`.

## 4. Update TRENDS.md

This section is NOT skippable on a quiet pass: the `observation_queue` maintenance is owed
every run.

- ROUTE every captured primary — do NOT default to "below bar, queue it": (a) on an EXISTING
  trend's axis → APPEND as evidence (a single primary IS evidence for an existing trend; the
  ≥3 bar is only for CREATING one); keep max 10 evidence, update `last_evidence`; (b) a queue
  cluster of ≥3 independent groups on one untracked sub-theme → promote to a `seed` trend;
  (c) else → `observation_queue` (below-bar is the queue's purpose, incl. exploration finds;
  never leave a named primary in report prose or another trend's `notes` only).
- CAPTURE, don't just attribute: any lane that NAMES a primary must end the run with it routed
  to evidence/queue — never "noted in prose". This includes a trend's own `notes`: writing a
  primary into another trend's notes as a below-bar/adjacent aside is NOT capture — "below the
  bar for trend X" routes it to the `observation_queue` as its OWN item (so study-pick selection
  and the convergence check can see it), never parks it in X's prose; a primary that lives only
  inside a trend's notes is invisible to both. Reconciliation (every run): a primary named in any
  report or trend `notes` but absent as a discrete queue item / evidence line is a capture leak —
  queue it now.
- CAPTURE the SOURCE too (source-discovery): the same capture applies to WHERE a primary came
  from. When a lane names an on-axis primary, stage every UNTRACKED domain involved — BOTH (a) the
  org/domain that PUBLISHED it AND (b) the surface you DISCOVERED it THROUGH (the blog/site/feed/
  channel that pointed you to it) — appending/incrementing each one not already in a SOURCES.md
  swept list into SOURCES.md → "Discovered-source candidates" (a tally: domain — times seen — last
  artifact+date — first-seen date). Case (b) fires EVEN when the primary itself sits on a TRACKED
  venue: a paper found via an untracked vendor/research/pointer blog that linked the arXiv id means
  that blog is an untracked high-signal source — stage it; don't let "the venue is tracked" hide
  the pointer. Tally only, NO extra fetch — you
  already hold the URL. Sources are discovered like items and curators: the daily STAGES, the
  weekly VERIFIES and PROMOTES. This is what lets the radar grow its own source coverage instead
  of waiting for the curator — an on-axis lab/vendor that announces only on its own channel must
  surface as a staged candidate the first run any lane names it.
- Stage moves: at most ONE stage up per trend per day, on new independent evidence. 21+ days
  quiet → `dormant` (weekly archives at 45+). Raise confidence to `high` only when ≥2
  INDEPENDENT authoritative primary sources corroborate on concrete artifacts, OR after
  sustained multi-week confirmation; otherwise `medium`.
- `observation_queue` maintenance (every run): add today's weak signals; promote those that
  clear the bar; cap-driven burndown to ~25 (resolve the oldest — promote or drop with a
  one-line reason in today's report; never silently delete).
- Convergence check (every run): scan the whole queue for sub-themes where ≥3 independent
  groups now hold artifacts → promote that cluster to a `seed`.
- Capture-leak reconciliation (every run — a CONCRETE mechanical sweep, not a judgment call):
  enumerate the primaries NAMED in every trend's `notes` and the last ~3 reports — run
  `grep -oE '[0-9]{4}\.[0-9]{5}' TRENDS.md` for arXiv ids (eyeball repo/release URLs) — then for
  EACH id `grep '<id>' TRENDS.md` and confirm it actually lands in the `observation_queue:` block
  or on an evidence line, NOT merely in prose that calls it "queued" / "adjacent" / "noted". Any
  id named-but-absent is a capture leak → QUEUE it this run (a below-bar primary belongs in the
  queue even when correctly NOT evidence for the trend whose notes mention it). State the result
  as `capture-leak: N ids checked / M queued` in today's report — its absence means the sweep was
  skipped.
- Append one dated line to `logs/source_rotation.md` (append-only). Update "Last updated".
- Regenerate `README.md` from the updated ledger in the same commit (`radar-render-dashboard`).

## 5. Study picks (study_shelf)
Select 0–2 items a quantum-computing / quantum-ML researcher should know — a tool, paper, technique, dataset or release.
The trend bar does NOT apply (a single strong artifact qualifies) but the evidence rules do
(opened primary sources). Add to `study_shelf` (newest first). Zero is fine.

## 6. Write the daily report
Create `reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (under ~60 lines): ledger changes; Top 3 of the day (one
line + link each); study picks; `capture-leak: N ids checked / M queued` (required every run,
even at 0); Next (open questions, what tomorrow should check first).

## 7. Persist
- `git add -A`, commit `radar: daily update YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Push to `main`: `git push origin HEAD:main`, even if the session started on a `claude/*`
  branch (the curator authorizes pushing to `main`; `claude/*` notices describe the default,
  not a prohibition). Push ONLY main. If rejected: retry once after `git pull --rebase origin
  main`; only if the server still rejects it, push to the session branch, open the report with
  a BRANCH WARNING, and paste the verbatim error. Never force-push.

## Failure modes
- `TRENDS.md` missing/malformed → restore the most recent valid version from git history,
  re-verify what you can, document the repair. Only if none exists: report and stop.
- No web access → write a report noting the outage, make no ledger changes.
