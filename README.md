Autonomous radar tracking the quantum-computing research frontier and its intersection with AI — quantum machine learning, enabling hardware and error correction, and the classical-quantum boundary — for quantum-computing researchers. Generated from [TRENDS.md](TRENDS.md).

**Since last scan (2026-09-11):**
- [AI-for-quantum (circuit synthesis)](TRENDS.md#id-trend-012-ai-for-quantum-circuit-synthesis-leg-generativetransformer-models-that-directly-synthesize-quantum-circuits) grew to a 5th independent group: [GenQAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.11248), a reinforcement-learning framework using prioritized generative replay to fix sample starvation in quantum architecture search.
- Three cap-swaps refreshed standing candidates with fresh independent groups: [Neural Quantum States](TRENDS.md#id-trend-005-neural-quantum-states-classical-neural-network-ansätze-for-quantum-many-body-wavefunctions), [Quantum reservoir computing](TRENDS.md#id-trend-008-quantum-reservoir-computing-fixed-quantum-dynamics-as-a-trainable-readout-feature-map) and [Quantum-advantage scrutiny](TRENDS.md#id-trend-006-quantum-advantage-skepticism-dequantization-honest-baselines-and-nisq-advantage-refutations).
- Xanadu and AMD released [Backline](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2026/09/real-time-classical-processing-with-backline-amd), an open-source real-time quantum-classical co-processing fabric built into PennyLane's Catalyst compiler — captured to the watchlist and study shelf.
- **Watchlist grew 26 → 28** (4 promoted, 3 dropped, 9 added) — see the [burndown](TRENDS.md#observation_queue).

## Worth studying

- [From Python to hardware: real-time classical co-processing with PennyLane, Backline, and AMD](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2026/09/real-time-classical-processing-with-backline-amd) — Xanadu + AMD (Sep 10): Backline, an open-source heterogeneous compilation fabric built into PennyLane's Catalyst compiler, dynamically routes quantum-classical workloads — including the microsecond-scale real-time feedback loops fault-tolerant QEC needs — to CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs.
- [The cost of simulating classically tractable quantum circuits and dynamics (arXiv:2609.11847)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.11847) — Chang, Thanasilp, Holmes, Cerezo (Sep 10): distinguishes asymptotic polynomial-time classical simulability from PRACTICAL classical cost, showing expensive preprocessing or quantum-data-acquisition overheads can make a "classically simulable" quantum evolution not actually cheaper to simulate than to run quantumly.
- [How GPT-5.6 Sol helps run quantum computing experiments](https://openai.com/index/codex-quantum-computing-experiments/) — OpenAI (Sep 8): an MIT graduate student connects GPT-5.6 Sol, harnessed to Codex, directly to lab software controlling a six-qubit superconducting chip, letting the agent autonomously run calibration/measurement sequences and decide what to try next.
- [The First Full-Stack Blueprint for Breaking 256-Bit Elliptic Curve Signatures](https://ionq.com/blog/the-first-full-stack-blueprint-for-breaking-256-bit-elliptic-curve-signatures) — IonQ (Sep 8): a 70-page resource estimate compiles Shor's algorithm for secp256k1 down to QEC primitives on a specialized trapped-ion architecture, cutting the qubit count needed from 1.2M+ to ~19,397 — read as a 2028-roadmap projection, not an achieved break.
- [Bottom-Up Design of Quantum Optical Experiments Using Discrete Generative Models (arXiv:2609.08073)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.08073) — Huidobro-Meezs, Paiva-Ortega, Vargas-Hernández (Sep 8): a reward-driven generative framework (Grinch) learns to sample optical-circuit graphs for target quantum states directly from fidelity-based rewards, with no pre-existing training dataset.

- [A Sim-to-Real Study of Surface-Code Decoder Benchmarking (arXiv:2609.04557)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.04557) — Manor, Erhili, Jebbouri (Sep 3): tests whether decoder rankings under synthetic noise transfer to Google's Willow processor, the first below the surface-code threshold — rank agreement appears only once the noise model is sufficiently realistic.
- [SAR and InSAR Change Detection with Quantum Generative Models (arXiv:2609.05313)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.05313) — Sekwao, De, Hocken, Staniewicz, Epifanovsky, Stringham (Sep 3): a quantum generative model executed on an IonQ trapped-ion processor improves satellite radar change-detection for disaster response — a fresh independent group for trend-003.
- [Experimental validation of a compact fault-tolerant architecture for trapped ions (arXiv:2609.03194)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.03194) — Berthusen, Lavasani, Benhemou et al. (Quantinuum, Sep 3): validates a full early-fault-tolerant architecture — efficient logical encoding, low-overhead logical operations, AND non-Clifford resources, all at once — on Quantinuum's 98-qubit Helios trapped-ion processor.

- [MerLin v0.4.0 "Grimoire" release notes](https://github.com/merlinquantum/merlin/releases) — Quandela: adds ready-to-use photonic-QML models (ReservoirClassifier, PhotonicGenerator, QCNNClassifier), hardware-aware noisy-SLOS training, and a MerlinProcessor unifying local simulation with remote execution.
- [IBM Quantum Nighthawk r2 — more circuits, faster](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/nighthawk-r2) — IBM (Sep 2): a 120-qubit QPU replacing conditional reset with a dissipative-reset gadget, reporting a 25x circuit-throughput gain.

## Community pulse

_Unverified intake — community signals, not trend evidence._

- Hacker News stayed quiet on quantum this run beyond items already routed above; a "post-quantum DNSSEC" story and a "Quantum Black" (McKinsey design-system) name collision were both checked and are off this radar's quantum-computing scope.
- Digest coverage (Quantum Insider, Quantum Computing Report, Quantum Zeitgeist) stayed dominated by funding/business/partnership news (Infleqtion/Cisco, Altera/Riverlane, IBM/Lockheed/ETH Zürich), with the Backline release and a Chalmers hardware speedup the technical exceptions.
- Quantum Machines' blog reverted to unextractable again this run — a continuing caution against treating any single successful extraction as a confirmed fix.
- GitHub release-note detail (beyond PyPI version numbers) and fork-tree analysis were unreachable by either working method this run — a first for the WebFetch fallback specifically; watch if it recurs.
- YouTube's Qiskit/Sabine feeds continue their recurring intermittent break — no working substitute found across many weeks.
