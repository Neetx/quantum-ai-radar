# source_rotation — Quantum AI Radar coverage log

Append-only daily log of which sources were covered on which dates. Daily runs APPEND one
dated line here and read only the recent tail (last ~7 days). Never edit/reorder past lines.
Each entry names every swept source as opened or `degraded: <reason>`.
